Used Tkinter module to build a PasswordManager.
It lets you enter the website name and on clicking generate, a random and beautifully complex password is generated and populated in
the password Text widget.

The email Text widget is already pre-populated.
All you have to do is press the plus-sign, that triggers a pop-up asking if the details are okay.

If all looks good click yes to add the details to a JSON file.

If the JSON file doesn't exist an error message pops up

Lastly if the website is found on searching, a pop-up appears with the email and password associated with that account.
